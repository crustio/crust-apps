# IPFS Translation Project  🌐✍️🖖

Thank you for caring about localization! You are a good person.

We use [transifex.com](https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/public/) to manage translations. **Please don't edit the locale files directly.**

- Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/public/,
- select languages can help with
- Start translating!

Once most of the text for the app is translated into a new language, the locale files are generated and added to this repo automatically.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/new) if you'd like to help translate but something is not clear.

See https://github.com/ipfs/i18n for more information.
